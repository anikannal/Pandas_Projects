    "## What is the GroupBy function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas’ GroupBy is a powerful and versatile function in Python. It allows you to split your data into separate groups to perform computations for better analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me take an example to elaborate on this. Let’s say we are trying to analyze the salary of a person in an MBA batch. We can easily get a fair idea of their salary by determining the mean salary of the whole batch. But here ‘s a question – would the salary be affected by the gender of a person?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can group the batch into different gender groups and calculate their mean salary. This would give us a better insight into the salary of a student in the batch we are analyzing. But we can probably get an even better picture if we further separate these gender groups into different groups by the students prior degree and then take their mean salary. Maybe the prior degree has an impact on the earning potential after an MBA?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how separating people into separate groups and then applying a statistical value allows us to make better analysis than just looking at the statistical value of the entire population. This is what makes GroupBy so great!\n",
    "\n",
    "GroupBy allows us to group our data based on different features and get a more accurate idea about your data. It is a one-stop-shop for deriving deep insights from your data!"
