    "\n",
    "Our data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.\n",

    "Here's a [link](https://github.com/anikannal/Pandas_Data) to the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few areas of concern at the solar power plant -\n",

    "Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management\n",
